cross-browser-pointer-events
============================

A javascript facade for allowing pointer-events to work in browsers that don't support them


### This is a work in progress / proof of concept at the moment. 
My goal is to develop this into a dependable solution. I have some ideas for using canvas to draw overlaying graphics between elements on a screen but dependable cross browser pointer events is the missing library I need in order to effectively implement these ideas.
